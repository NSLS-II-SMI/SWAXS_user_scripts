# SWAXS_user_scripts 
This is the home of all custom user scripts for the NSLS-II SMI-SWAXS beamline.  Historical naming conventions were to have files with the form `30-lastname.py`.  
We have moved all of these old files to the `legacy/` directory. 

Now that this is a separate repo from the profile collection, we encourage each user group to create a folder of the form 

```lastname-xxxxxx/```

where `xxxxxx` is the proposal ID for your beamtime. 
Within this directory, you are free to use whatever naming scheme you choose, although a suggestion of the date and purpose of the scripts within are encouraged, i.e. `grazing_2025-2.py`.
