# SWAXS_user_scripts
This is the home of all custom user scripts for the NSLS-II SMi SWAXS beamline.  Historical naming conventions was to have 30-lastname.py.  We have moved all of these old files to the `legacy/` direcrtory.

Now that this is a seperate repo from the profile collection, We encourage each user group to create a folder of the form 
`lastname-xxxxxx/`
where `xxxxxx` is the proposal ID for your beamtime. 
Within this directory you are free to have whatever naming scheme you choose, although a suggestion of the date and purpose of the scripts within are encouraged, i.e. 
`grazing_2025-2.py`
